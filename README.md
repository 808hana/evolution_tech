In folder *libs* is included Benchmark Functions library made by Luca Baronti (https://gitlab.com/luca.baronti/python_benchmark_functions). 
This library was extended by five functions: Levy, Shubert, DropWave, CrossInTray and Bohachevsky.
In order for the code in *main.py* to execute you need to use this version of the library.
